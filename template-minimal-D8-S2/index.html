<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<i>What is original about your game?
</i> I think that the game is fairly original. It features a pretty unique style, objective set, and set of mechanics. The theme/story has some unique depth to it also.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<i>What is interesting about your game technology?
</i> 
One interesting technical aspect is how enemies have some level of decision-making. Each enemy is initially focused on a certain tower, but if that tower gets destroyed, they re-route to focus on a different tower. Trigonemtry is also used in various ways. Notably, trigonometry is used to determine the path of enemies, where they must traverse towards a tower. Trigonemtry is also used in relation to vectors, where the x and y components of velocity are found from a velocity magnitude and direction (angle). The game also has an interesting difficulty-increase mechanic, where enemies gradually start to spawn faster (up to a max rate) as the game progresses. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<i>What did you learn from this prototype?</i> 
I increased my knowledge of how collisions work specifically with using a callback function to determine if a collision registers. I also learned to use sprite/game-object data, which made organization easier.
<i>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?</i> 
I had some difficulty getting collisions to work as intended. A lot of updating and maintaining had to occur to make trap-enemy collisions work as desired.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<i>Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.</i> 
I used various images found through Google.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<i>Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.</i> 
I did not borrow code, but there are likely somewhat games out there, where it is a tower-defense type game. However, I think the implementation and style are pretty unique. One source of inspiration, however, was Bloons Tower Defense, which similarly has traps and an influx of enemies, but also contrastly has pre-defined paths, vastly different theme, and no enemy decision-making.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
<i>A one-sentence summary of your game.</i> 
Defend both towers as long as possible against the swarm of enemy soldiers.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
<i>State which of the Storymatic themes you used.</i> 
I used a Spartan theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<i>State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.</i> The input is keyboard (arrow keys) and mouse. There is randomness in the location and direction of enemies. The genre is a fighter or tower-defense game. The playstyle could be fighter, director, or performer.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
<i>What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?</i> 
This game shows object collisions, object movement, timing, and event-driven audio. Notably, a unique use of collisions was used to implement traps.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<i>What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?</i> 
Intense, fast-paced, fun, skill-based, replayable.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<i>A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.</i>
The player can start or stop/reset the game. Once started, they can move the character (spartan) with the arrow keys. The player can eliminate enemies by colliding with them. Money can be earned by the player eliminating enemies with their sword (without use of traps). Money can be used to buy traps from the UI bar, which are selected, bought, and placed with mouse clicks. Spike traps eliminate enemies, while Slime traps slow them down (each have limited uses/health). Enemies will spawn at randomized y-values and will randomly focus initially on a certain tower. Enemies will gradually spawn faster as the game progresses (up to a max) and will change their trajectory if their tower is destroyed. Once both towers are destroyed, the game ends.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<i>What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</i>
The primary strategy will involve constantly and wisely placing traps, which will also require constant money gain. I tend to think that a layered approach will be most useful. This approach could look like a slime layer farthest out around mid-map, then a trap layer after (closer to towers), and the player will be around the traps, in a position that allows for money-gain and quick saves. The player should also be conscious about what trap they have selected and be able to switch quickly. It could also be useful to prioritize one tower over the other, or at least realize when one tower is not worth saving. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
<i>A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</i>
The world is set in Ancient Greece (around 480 B.C.), where the player is a Spartan and the enemies are Persians (they were rivals). The premise is meant to be that the Spartan is protecting his base from a Persian attack, where the Persians are trying to destroy two important Greek buildings (towers). The Spartan must try to protect the buildings as long as possible to wait for reinforcement. The Spartan also has an arsenal of weapons to use, including his sword, spike traps, and slime traps. 

<i>How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</i>
As the spawn rate becomes faster, more enemies start to accumulate, and the towers become weaker, the game will become much more intense. The intensity of the gameplay will attempt to mimic the intensity progression that an ancient war may have. Hopefully the theme and gameplay intensity will yield an immersive experience.
</li> 

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
<i>A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</i>
This game could attract people that are interested in history (notably Ancient Greece), fighting games, tower-defense games, and intense high-score games.
</li> 

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
<i>How long does your game take to play?</i> 
The game has no max time limit, but likely a few minutes.
</li>
