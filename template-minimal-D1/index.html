<h2>Atom Clicker</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<i>What is original about your game?</i> It is not the most original game definitely, but probably sufficient for my first game. However, I think the real scale of the atoms provides an educational twist.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<i>What is interesting about your game technology?</i> I used random circle placement and color. I also utilized a basic timing system.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<i>What did you learn from this prototype?</i> I learned how to setup a basic phaser game and how to use some basic phaser features.
<i>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?</i> Figuring out how to use phaser and set everything up.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<i>Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.</i> I utilized a background from the assets of phaser example projects 
<ul>
<li>Phaser Link: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples">Phaser examples</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<i>Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.</i> I did not borrow code, but a Steam game called "osu!" has a similar idea.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
<i>A one-sentence summary of your game.</i> Click as many circles before the time expires.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
<i>State which of the Storymatic themes you used.</i> I was struggling with a theme, but to give the game some story, I will say that the circles are atoms (they look like classroom model atoms), not just circles, and use the Chemist theme. The circles are proportional to their corresponding atomic radius and have their element name on them.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<i>State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.</i> The input is the mouse. Randomness is found in the circle's color and placement. The genre is kind of like competitive time-based. The playstyle would be Competitor.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
<i>What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?</i> Item placement, removal, and modification.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<i>What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?</i> Intense and competitive.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<i>A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.</i>
The player can start or stop/reset the game. Once started, they play the game by clicking on the circles that spawn. When they click circles, the circles are removed and the score is incremented. As time passes, the timer is also incremented. The player must click as many circles before the timer expires.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<i>What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?</i>
Having a trigger finger and focusing on atom clusters and larger atoms should be advantageous.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
<i>A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.</i>
The world would be the background and the circles. The background is in space, giving the game a mystic setting. For thematic and story purposes, the circles can be interpreted as chemical atoms,as they look like the class models.
<i>How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?</i>
I wouldn't say there's much dramatic tension, but as the time approaches the max, tension should rise.
</li> 

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
<i>A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.</i>
 This game could attract competitors or aim-trainers.
</li> 

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
<i>How long does your game take to play?</i> The game takes around 10 seconds to play. It is a replayable high-score game.
</li>
